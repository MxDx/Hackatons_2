    "In the first exercise, you will develop a model for estimating the cooling/heating load indexes of a building from its characteristics. These indexes serve as reference to adapt the power of air conditioning systems. In the second exercise, you will forecast the hourly electric power consumption in Spain. Electricity being not storable, predicting the electric consumption is a crucial matter for energy producers. You will develop an autoregressive model for this purpose. \n",

    "When designing a building, the computation of the heating load (HL) and the cooling load (CL) is required to determine the specifications of the heating and cooling equipment needed to maintain comfortable indoor air conditions. Architects and building designers need information about the characteristics of the building and of the conditioned space. For this reason, we  investigate the effect of eight input variables: (RC), surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution, to determine the output variables HL and CL of residential buildings.\n",
